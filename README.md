PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
Healthcare - Empowering traveling doctors with AI
 Scenario: 
Ravi is a traveling doctor who provides healthcare services to multiple rural communities across Jharkhand. With limited time 
and resources, he finds it challenging to deliver consistent care to all his patients. Many of his patients have chronic conditions 
that require regular monitoring, but the lack of a centralized system means Ravi often has to rely on paper records, which are 
incomplete or outdated. This makes it difficult for him to provide accurate and timely care, leading to potential health risks for 
his patients. The system should also store patient data over time and help the doctor use the longitudinal data to predict disease 
progression for better care recommendations. 
He wants an economical tech-based solution that can process different data sources and help him in decision and knowledge 
support in the field. The system should have Responsible AI and data privacy built in, given the sensitive nature of the data.
 Student’s challenge: 
Design an AI-powered mobile health platform that enables healthcare providers like Ravi to efficiently manage patient care 
across multiple locations. The solution should facilitate the tracking of chronic conditions, allow for the easy input and retrieval 
of patient data, and provide AI-driven insights for better decision-making. It could include features such as remote monitoring, 
predictive analytics for health deterioration and automated alerts for necessary follow-ups.
 Since the solution should be available for commercial use, include models that we can deploy for commercial use and not just 
for research purpose.

Presentation: RuralCare - Revolutionizing Healthcare with Technology
Motto: "Reliable, Remote, Responsive Care for Every Community"

Storyline:
In many rural households, especially among housewives like my mother, chronic diseases often go unchecked due to lack of access to healthcare. They rely on male family members for checkups, but due to their busy schedules, regular medical attention becomes a distant priority. Additionally, the limited availability of doctors and overcrowded clinics make it difficult to receive proper care. I envision a solution that empowers housewives and other community members to take charge of their health, ensuring they receive consistent, timely, and quality medical care without depending on others.

Proposed Solution:
Our solution, RuralCare, is a comprehensive mobile platform designed to empower individuals, especially women in rural areas, to manage their healthcare independently and effectively. The platform addresses several key challenges faced by patients and healthcare providers, ensuring convenience, accessibility, and efficiency.
1.	Doctor Search & Appointment Booking:
Users can access a list of doctors based on their specialization, availability, and location. This feature allows housewives and other patients to easily book appointments with doctors, either online or offline, ensuring timely checkups without unnecessary delays. The system allows them to view doctor schedules in real-time and select the most suitable appointment time.
2.	Hospital Information & Facility Availability:
The app provides a list of hospitals along with details about their available facilities—such as the number of hospital beds, available medications, lab testing centers, and patient occupancy in different wards. Patients can check real-time hospital capacity and make informed decisions when seeking care.
3.	Personalized Diet Plans:
Based on answers to simple dietary questions, AI-powered diet recommendations are generated with the help of medical experts and nutritionists. This ensures that patients can follow a healthy, tailored diet that aligns with their chronic conditions and health goals.
4.	Medicine Management & Delivery:
Patients will receive their prescriptions and medication dosages, along with timely reminders for medication intake. If needed, delivery partners can deliver medicines directly to their homes, making it easier for them to adhere to their treatment regimen.
5.	Medication Adherence Tracking:
To improve health outcomes, patients can log whether they take their medicine on time and in the prescribed quantity. This data is updated in real time, allowing for better tracking of medication adherence and identifying potential issues or impacts.
6.	Patient History & Tracking:
The platform maintains a comprehensive patient history and real-time updates on their current health status. Doctors, nurses, and medical staff can easily access this information to monitor patients' conditions, ensuring they receive the right care at the right time.
7.	Emergency Assistance & Ambulance Services:
In case of an emergency or complications, patients can instantly access ambulance services through an "Emergency" button on the app. This feature automatically detects the patient's identity and location, ensuring immediate assistance and rapid transport to nearby hospitals.
8.	Data Security & Privacy:
We prioritize the privacy and security of patient data. Through collaborations with government bodies and third-party organizations, we ensure that all patient and hospital staff information is protected, adhering to stringent data privacy regulations.
